# WinTube

**WinTube** is a modern, open-source YouTube client for **UWP** and **Windows Phone**. Built with the MVVM architecture and written in clean, maintainable code, WinTube brings a native, smooth YouTube experience without relying on third-party proxies/APIs.

> ⚠️ **Beta Notice:** WinTube is still in development. There are no official releases yet — you’ll need to compile it yourself. Despite that, it is already usable.

## Features

* **Direct YouTube Playback** – No proxy or third-party API - native playback using YouTube's own data.
* **Video Options** – Select **video quality**, **video format**, and **audio language/quality**.
* **Subtitle Support** – Display available subtitles on supported videos.
* **Search Functionality** – Search YouTube content directly from the app.
* **Video Metadata** – View video **title**, **description**, **channel name**, **like count**, and more.
* **MVVM Architecture** – Built using clean, modular, and maintainable MVVM design.
* **Actively Maintained** – Bug fixes, features, and improvements are continuously being worked on.

## Known Limitations

* If you encounter the error: **"video could not be decoded"**, try switching the video format in the playback options — this usually resolves the issue.

## Future Plans

Here’s what’s coming soon:

* **Live Stream Support**
* **Playlist Support**
* **Channel Pages**
* **Settings Page**
* **YouTube Account Integration**

2. **Open in Visual Studio**:
